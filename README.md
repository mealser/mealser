### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 <p>I am a Senior Researcher and (http://www.vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/dozent.view?dozide=10060652&semkez=2021S&lang=en)Lecturer</a> of bioinformatics and computer architecture at <a href="https://safari.ethz.ch/">SAFARI Research Group</a>, <a href="https://ee.ethz.ch/">D-ITET</a>, <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html">ETH ZÃ¼rich</a> and a former memeber of <a href="https://inf.ethz.ch/">D-INFK</a>. </p>
                        
<p>My main research is in bioinformatics, computational genomics, metagenomics, and computer architecture. I am especially excited about building new data structures, algorithms, and architectures that make intelligent computation on population-scale sequencing data a reality. I am also excited about system design, using existing and unconventional (e.g., non-von Neumann) computing paradigms, for bioinformatics and big-data applications. I closely advise and mentor several graduate and undergraduate students (>26 overall) at ETH ZÃ¼rich, CMU, and Bilkent University. <a href="https://safari.ethz.ch/work-with-us/">Work with us!</a>
</p>
<p>I earned my PhD in Computer Engineering from <a href="http://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/">Bilkent University</a>, Turkey, where I was awarded the <a href="https://www.tubitak.gov.tr/">TÃœBITAK</a> doctoral fellowship. I am fortunate to work with <a href="http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~calkan/">Can Alkan</a> and <a href="https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/">Onur Mutlu</a> on my own doctoral research ideas. My PhD thesis, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03936">&ldquo;Accelerating the Understanding of Life's Code Through Better Algorithms and Hardware Design&rdquo;</a>, received the <a href="https://site.ieee.org/turkey/2018-yili-ieee-turkiye-bilim-odulleri-sahiplerini-buldu/">IEEE Turkey Doctoral Dissertation Award</a> and I was named as <a href="http://bilnews.bilkent.edu.tr/computer-engineering-phd-student-receives-yasser-arafat-award/">the Best Palestinian PhD Student in Turkey</a>. I was previously working at <a href="http://zarlab.cs.ucla.edu">ZarLab</a> (<a href="http://www.ucla.edu/">UCLA</a>), <a href="https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/news">CfAED</a> (<a href="https://tu-dresden.de/">TU Dresden</a>), and <a href="http://www.petronas.com.my">PETRONAS</a>.</p>
