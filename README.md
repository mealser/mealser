### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>I am a Senior Researcher and <a href="http://www.vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/dozent.view?dozide=10060652&semkez=2021S&lang=en">Lecturer</a> of bioinformatics and computer architecture at <a href="https://safari.ethz.ch/">SAFARI Research Group</a>, <a href="https://ee.ethz.ch/">D-ITET</a>, <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html">ETH ZÃ¼rich</a> and a former memeber of <a href="https://inf.ethz.ch/">D-INFK</a>. </p>

<p>My main research is in bioinformatics, computational genomics, metagenomics, and computer architecture. I am especially excited about building new data structures, algorithms, and architectures that make intelligent computation on population-scale sequencing data a reality. I am also excited about system design, using existing and unconventional (e.g., non-von Neumann) computing paradigms, for bioinformatics and big-data applications. I closely advise and mentor several graduate and undergraduate students (>26 overall) at ETH ZÃ¼rich, CMU, and Bilkent University. <a href="https://safari.ethz.ch/work-with-us/">Work with us!</a>
